## Description
A Flutter Chat App that uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to allow sending and receiving messages between 2 users:
1. A simple chat app that allows communication between sender and receiver.
2. Use a notification to inform the user of the new message received.
3. The messaging screen should contain input (message) and output (response) on the same screen, like other messaging apps.
4. Sender and receiver will be identified by their email, which is registered in Firebase Authentication.
5. You can use multiple screens and routing to enhance your app.
